# Blender Key Configuration for XSI Users

The aim is to create a key configuration that is not deviating entirely from Blender's, but at the same time familiar to artists coming from XSI.

In addition to importing this key configuration, what could also help is setting left mouse button for selection and setting camera roll style to _Turntable Orbit_.

Please open an issue if you find something wrong with this key configuration. I am completely new to Blender and would love to learn some things from my mistakes.
